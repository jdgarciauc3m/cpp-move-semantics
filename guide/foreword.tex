\chapter*{Foreword}

Welcome!

Move semantics was one of the key features in C++11. Since then every 
new edition of the language had something to say.

This is not a book. It is just the support material for a course on how you can
make use of move semantics in modern C++. Note that this course assumes that you
already have enough background on C++.

I hope you find this course useful to improve your skills as a software
engineer allowing you to write better software.
